For small and medium businesses, probably the most important aspect when
choosing a data warehouse system is cost, both for the initial development and
for the ongoing maintenance of such a system.

Nowadays, Software as a Service (SaaS) can provide many advantages over
traditional services. The pay-as-you-go model is very friendly towards small
businesses which could not otherwise easily justify the upfront cost for
servers and related costs for hosting a data warehouse.

This means that, in many cases, SaaS is the most cost-effective and also the
simplest solution for small businesses to opt for. When comparing them to
traditional services, SaaS products virtually don't need any setup time and
can be deployed instantly.

In the case of data warehouse systems, SaaS is also commonly referred to as
Data Warehouse as a Service (DWaaS).

Given the advantages above, we focus in this section on some concrete DWaaS
products and review what they have in common, how they differ and whether they
are in fact suitable for small businesses.
