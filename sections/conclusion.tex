Concluding from this work, we can say that small and medium enterprises are
generally in the need for a data warehouse system, yet they need to rely on
dedicated services offering a specialised solution since they cannot afford
an on-premise DWH. Cloud-based SaaS offerings provide a viable and affordable
opportunity to use such a data warehouse in a pay-as-you-go fashion.

The reviewed cloud services show that there are multiple different systems
which are ideally suited for SMEs. All services have a variety of plans
designed for different sizes of smaller businesses. Furthermore, the
integration with possible data sources is well supported across all of the
reviewed systems. The majority of the reviewed services also support data
analysis with the integration of different business intelligence tools.
Additionally, custom queries written in SQL are also possible for all services,
giving SMEs maximum flexibility when accessing their data.

Overall, we can conclude that cloud based data warehouse services are a very
good and efficient solution for small and medium enterprises to improve data
management and analysis. The services fully tackle the complicated needs of
SMEs, while offering an attractive price structure. Therefore we can assume
that there exists an almost ideal service for most SMEs.
