With an increasing level of digitisation, the amount of data, that companies are dealing with, is increasing rapidly across all business sectors. Nowadays, especially small and medium enterprises are struggling to properly process all of their data, as they do not have a proper infrastructure to manage it. Therefore, the usage of data warehouse (DWH) systems is becoming more popular in the SME sector, since it provides an easy way to collect the entire business data in one place, while gaining better possibilities for analytical insights. This lead to a high development of dedicated DWH services, which specifically target SMEs. Those are typically designed as a software as a service (SaaS), with a flexible pay as you go model. This paper aims to highlight the specific needs for such specialised systems and compares different cloud-based data warehouse services for their suitability within small and medium enterprises, while using a predefined review methodology. The comparison is followed up by some performance examples for the tested systems. The conclusion reflects on the current state of DWH services and their general applicability for smaller companies and summarises the best services within the set of reviewed ones.
