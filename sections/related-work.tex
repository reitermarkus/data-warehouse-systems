As the amount of digital data is ever increasing for all companies, the effort to manage it grows exponentially. To structure that data, most business have the option of implementing a data warehouse. Although there are many existing DWH implementations, only some are actually applicable to the setting of a smaller business. This is due to the fact that SMEs tend to lack certain expertise and have a limited budget, as well as a small amount of spare employees for IT. This further aggravates the use of many traditional DWH solutions, as they are tailored towards big enterprises and include many features, which are not relevant for a SME \cite{Raj2016}.

Furthermore, on-premise data warehouse systems require a certain level of storage and computing power, to fully utilise the advantages of the software. Those solutions often have a high up-front cost, making them a less ideal solution for a SME. Therefore, many vendors of DWH solutions offer their product as a cloud-based subscription service, which is well received by customers \cite{Agostino2013}.

Cloud-based data warehouses enable smaller business to fully utilise all needed features of the DWH technology, as they require considerably less time and expertise to set up and configure. Additionally, there is no up-front cost, as there is no local infrastructure required. Many popular vendors also offer a \textit{pay-as-you-go} subscription, which gives customers flexibility to try out their system for a very low fee. The reduction in cost and a static monthly payment model is the main reason why smaller companies can even consider implementing a DWH in their business process, as this was previously the main barrier, \cite{Fernandes2016}.

Business Intelligence (BI) is a systematic approach that compromises a set of tools and guidelines, which helps a business to analyse its operations and report on different statistics. Systems that offer BI features, are use a data warehouse for analytical queries. While this is a common approach within global enterprises for years, SMEs rarely adopt any form of business intelligence, since the lack the expertise and capabilities to deploy systems for it ~\cite{Golfarelli2004}.

SMEs therefore require a simple and streamlined approach, as they are not able to analytically deal with big data in their existing systems. With the addition of cloud computing, SMEs no longer need complex hardware and software systems, which have high maintenance costs, to deal with big data. \textit{Vajjhala and Ramollari} argue that cloud services also encapsulate some of the complexity, giving SMEs the chance the acquire flexible computing power for data warehouses to use business intelligence tools ~\cite{Vajjhala2016}.

PRESTA is a system used in a methodology that helps SMEs to measure the performance management. This system can generate specific data warehouses and it is responsible for data input and calculating norm values. Different organisations are seeking new systems to track the progress against plans and for flexible allocations of resources. Traditional systems include ERP and business intelligence systems but it is not sufficient. Business Performance Management (BPM) is a term to integrate key indicator of performance into management processes. The best known model for BPM is the Balanced Scorecard of Kaplan and Norton. Data around the company gets integrated into a DWH system in a consistent and reliable way. There are different tools needed in such systems like the front end, or the standard C/S tools. C/S tools are responsible for the development of customised data applications. Further EIS/DSS tools are needed to generate high-end multidimensional analysis which are more complex. Finally data mining tools are needed. Since different data mining products are exploratory to identify information without an initial question or hypothesis, specific data mining tools are needed to avoid this. In order to get a multidimensional view on the data it has to be organised in fact and dimension tables. To become a generic performance management tool for a range of business situations a generic data model needs to be defined by having a list of critical success factors and performance indicators. These indicators (PI) variables are organised in facts and dimension tables. In the management analysis the PI measurement model has to be implemented in a way such that it delivers report of PI measures and also selected norm values. These reports are very helpful in determining business problems. The PRESTA system is planned to be a generic DWH based performance management system. Based on the input of the PIs it generates a DWH dimensional data structure and data gets input automatically. Considering that the operational database structure is far from complete, tables can also be input manually. Since manual input can lead to double data, data gets input on PI measurement variables level which means that measurements are kept at company level and loses detailed data. PRESTA is based on a web application and uses a MySQL database. In order for it to be become a full DWH based system, in the near future it will get a PRESTA based data warehouse where the system itself gets data feed directly from there.~\cite{Schreurs2007}
