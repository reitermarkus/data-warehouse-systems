As the amount of digital data is ever increasing for all companies, the effort to manage it grows exponentially. To structure that data, most business have the option of implementing a data warehouse. Although there are many existing DWH implementations, only some are actually applicable to the setting of a smaller business. This is due to the fact that SME's tend to lack certain expertise and have a limited budget, as well as a small amount of spare employees for IT. This further aggravates the use of many traditional DWH solutions, as they are tailored towards big enterprises and include many features, which are not relevant for a SME \cite{Raj2016}.

Furthermore, on-premise data warehouse systems require a certain level of storage and computing power, to fully utilize the advantages of the software. Those solutions often have a high up-front cost, making them a less ideal solution for a SME. Therefore, many vendors of DWH solutions offer their product as a cloud-based subscription service, which is well received by customers \cite{Agostino2013}.

Cloud-based data warehouses enable smaller business to fully utilize all needed features of the DWH technology, as they require considerably less time and expertise to set up and configure. Additionally, there is no up-front cost, as there is no local infrastructure required. Many popular vendors also offer a \textit{pay-as-you-go} subscription, which gives customers flexibility to try out their system for a very low fee. The reduction in cost and a static monthly payment model is the main reason why smaller companies can even consider implementing a DWH in their business process, as this was previously the main barrier, \cite{Fernandes2016}.
